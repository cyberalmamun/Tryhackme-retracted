## Overview

This repository contains a short README with highlights and notes from solving the *Retracted* room on TryHackMe. It is intentionally minimal — meant for adding screenshots and short commands to demonstrate completion.

## Key takeaways

* Learned and practised techniques used in the Retracted room.
* Collected flags and completed the challenges.

## Walkthrough (short)

1. Enumerated targets and services.
2. Used common enumeration tools and techniques to gather information.
3. Exploited identified weaknesses to gain foothold.
4. Escalated privileges and retrieved flags.

> Add a more detailed step-by-step walkthrough or commands in `WALKTHROUGH.md` if you want to expand later.
